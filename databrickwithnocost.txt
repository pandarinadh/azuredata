How to save Databricks demo Cost
Databricks demo could be costly because you will have to create clusters, and that could be expensive even if you select the lowest configuration. And that's why sometimes you even would not be able to create a Databricks cluster using your Free subscription.

Alternate Solution

You can use the community edition of Databricks which is free and works fine.

Error using Free Subscription

Few students have mentioned that they are not able to create Databricks cluster using a Free subscription trial. They are getting errors like

"A cloud provider error was encountered while setting up the cluster. "

"Operation could not be completed as it results in exceeding approved Total Regional Cores quota."

Unfortunately, I am not able to replicate this issue because my free tried has expired long back.

Solution for Error

However one of the students has also figured out how to resolve the above issue. Please find his comment below.

I resolved this issue yesterday. You can follow the below steps and check if this works for you.

1. Your databricks cluster will not work with Azure Free Trial Subscription. Refer the link below. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/scenarios/quickstart-create-databricks-workspace-portal#create-a-spark-cluster-in-databricks

2. You need to upgrade your account to pay-as-you-go. This takes approx 15 mins to reflect with your account settings.

3. Delete the workspace you created earlier.

4. Create a new databricks standard workspace, not the trial 14 days one

5. Configure your cluster with minimal resources to cut down the cost. Say min. worker nodes: 1 and max worker nodes:2 (Standard_DS3_v2)

6. Driver node same as worker. So bare minimum you are requesting 8 cores (4 for driver and 4 for worker)

7. Spin up your cluster. This should work now.
